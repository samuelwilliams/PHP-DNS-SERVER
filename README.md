# PHP DNS Server

This is an Authoritative DNS Server written in pure PHP.
It will listen to DNS request on the default port (Default: port 53) and give answers about any domain that it has DNS records for.
This class can be used to give DNS responses dynamically based on your pre-existing PHP code.

## Requirements

* `PHP 7.1+`
* Needs either `sockets` or `socket_create` PHP extension loaded (which they are by default)

## Example

Here is an example of DNS server usage:
```php
require_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

// JsonResolver created and provided with path to file with json dns records
$jsonResolver = new yswery\DNS\Resolver\JsonResolver([
    '/path/to/zones/example.com.json',
    '/path/to/zone/test.com.json',
]);

// System resolver acting as a fallback to the JsonResolver
$systemResolver = new yswery\DNS\Resolver\SystemResolver();

// StackableResolver will try each resolver in order and return the first match
$stackableResolver = new yswery\DNS\Resolver\StackableResolver([$jsonResolver, $systemResolver]);

// Create the eventDispatcher and add the event subscribers
$eventDispatcher = new \Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcher();
$eventDispatcher->addSubscriber(new \yswery\DNS\Event\Subscriber\EchoLogger());

// Create a new instance of Server class
$server = new yswery\DNS\Server($stackableResolver, $eventDispatcher);

// Start DNS server
$server->start();

```
### Running example

* Run `composer install` to install dependencies
* Run `php example/example.php` to run the server

Query server using `dig` command to ensure proper functioning
```bash
$ dig @127.0.0.1 test.com A +short
111.111.111.111

$ dig @127.0.0.1 test.com TXT +short
"Some text."

$ dig @127.0.0.1 test2.com A +short
111.111.111.111
112.112.112.112
```
## Zone File Storage
PHP DNS Server supports four zone file formats out-of-the-box: JSON, XML, YAML, and Bind; each file format
is supported by a specialised `Resolver` class: `JsonResolver`, `XmlResolver`, `YamlResolver`, and `BindResolver`,
respectively. Example files are in the `example/` directory.

### JSON zone example
```json
{
  "domain": "example.com.",
  "default-ttl": 7200,
  "resource-records": [
    {
      "name": "@",
      "ttl": 10800,
      "type": "SOA",
      "class": "IN",
      "mname": "example.com.",
      "rname": "postmaster",
      "serial": 2,
      "refresh": 3600,
      "retry": 7200,
      "expire": 10800,
      "minimum": 3600
    }, {
      "type": "A",
      "address": "12.34.56.78"
    },{
      "type": "A",
      "address": "90.12.34.56"
    }, {
      "type": "AAAA",
      "address": "2001:acad:ad::32"
    }, {
      "name": "www",
      "type": "cname",
      "target": "@"
    }, {
      "name": "@",
      "type": "MX",
      "preference": 15,
      "exchange": "mail"
    }, {
      "name": "*.subdomain",
      "ttl": 3600,
      "type": "A",
      "address": "192.168.1.42"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Running Tests

Unit tests using PHPUnit are provided. A simple script is located in the root.

* run `composer install` to install PHPUnit and dependencies
* run `vendor/bin/phpunit` from the root to run the tests

## Building .phar
* run `composer run-script build-server` to build the phpdnsserver.phar file, outputs in the bin folder.
* run `composer run-script build-console` to build the phpdnscli.phar file, outputs in the bin folder.
* run  `composer run-script build-installer` to build the installer. Windows support for the installer is currently limited.

## Running the .phar files
To run the new .phar files, download them from the release and move them to the desired folder.
* `phpdnsserver.phar` to run the phpdnsserver, uses the new filesystem by default
* `phpdnscli.phar` to run cli commands
* `phpdnsinstaller.phar` as root to create required folders and default config.

## Supported command line switches
* `--bind:b` - bind to a specific ip. Uses `0.0.0.0` by default
* `--port:p` - bind to a specific port. Uses port `53` by default
* `--config:c` - specify the config file. Uses `phpdns.json` on windows 
and `/etc/phpdns.json` on unix systems by default
* `--storage:s` - specify the path to the storage for zones, and logs. Uses `/etc/phpdnsserver` on unix,
and current working directory on windows.

## Supported Record Types

* A
* NS
* CNAME
* SOA
* PTR
* MX
* TXT
* AAAA
* AXFR
* ANY
* SRV
